# APPS-ad-tools-iOS

Wrapping library around AppLovin and Sourcepoint SDK to simplify the integration of consents and ads and not waste time debugging

For any questions regarding the integration, slack **@Loic Saillant, Sarra Srairi or Gautier GÃ©doux**

## installation

* copy/paste the Podfile or the element in it in at the root of your app folder and change the Target name inside it by your app name
* Add the Common, Ads and Privacy folder to your project
* Run `pod repo update` then `pod install` in your terminal

## Integration steps

* Add SDK dependencies (see Installation section above)
* Add the dependency for each network in your app
    * Check https://developers.applovin.com/en/ios/preparing-mediated-networks for each network
      to see if you need additional steps
      see https://developers.applovin.com/en/ios/testing-networks/mediation-debugger/)
    * You will Generate all required SKAdNetwork keys for your info.plist file here: https://developers.applovin.com/en/ios/overview/skadnetwork/
    * Bigo requires extra parameters when fetching an ad, see https://www.bigossp.com/guide/sdk/ios/mediation/maxAdapter#5-load-and-show-an-ad
    * Note: by calling `ALSdk.shared().showMediationDebugger()`
      you can launch the mediation debugger and check that every integration is working properly
      (and enable test mode to test a specific network)   
* Configure the ad review plugin by following the steps
  here https://developers.applovin.com/en/ios/overview/integration#enable-ad-review
* Update the Config.swift file with the proper credential present in this file https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10GfnMXMkHk4YTUA1xX9oIcqg-vzzLkAdiWUDXRK9lU8/edit?pli=1#gid=0

To display the ad properly in your app see the next section

## Usage

Ask for consent in you `AppDelegate.swift` file in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method

```swift
        PrivacyManager.shared.configure { analyticsEnabled, adsEnabled in
            if analyticsEnabled {
                //TODO: configure analytics
            } else {
                //TODO: stop analytics
            }
            
            if adsEnabled {
                AdInitializer.launchAdsSDK(
                    hasUserConsent: PrivacyManager.shared.hasUserConsent,
                    doNotSell: PrivacyManager.shared.doNotSellEnabled,
                    isAgeRestrictedUser: PrivacyManager.shared.isAgeRestrictedUser
                )
            } else {
                AdInitializer.resetAdsSDK()
            }
        }
```

You will also need to ad a CTA in the settings view to display consent and allowing him to opt out

```swift
        if PrivacyManager.shared.shouldPrivacyApplicable() {
                //Add your CTA in Setting with the following trigger
                PrivacyManager.shared.loadAndDisplayConsentUI()     
        }
```

Once the Ads are properly initialized (you should see a lot of stuff in the logs) you can start the implementation in the feed

* The main class to display and load ads is called the `AdCoordinator` it's should be the only class your app will interract with
* Everytime the feed get a full refresh, you should call `AdCoordinator.shared.reload()`
* The  


## Cool tips

* To test a specific network:
    * you might need to change your location with a VPN
    * some free VPN won't work, NordVPN seems to work
    * the location will depend of the network (some networks only serve in a few countries)
  * in the `configureSettings` block add the following call:

```kotlin
setExtraParameter("test_mode_network", "ADMOB_BIDDING")
```

* If loading ads starts to get slow or you get a lot of no-fill, try to reset your advertising ID
